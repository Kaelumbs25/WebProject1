                <aside>Grand Theft Auto VI is an upcoming video game in development by Rockstar Games. It is due to be the eighth main Grand Theft Auto game, following Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and the sixteenth entry overall.

                    Following years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February 2022 that the game was in development.
