                <h2>Learning through Games</h2>
                <p>
                    Games and learning is a field of education research that studies what is learned by playing video games, and how the design principles, data and communities of video game play can be used to develop new learning environments. Video games create new social and cultural worlds â€“ worlds that help people learn by integrating thinking, social interaction, and technology, all in service of doing things they care about.[1] Computers and other technologies have already changed the way students learn. Integrating games into education has the potential to create new and more powerful ways to learn in schools, communities and workplaces.[1] Games and learning researchers study how the social and collaborative aspects of video gameplay can create new kinds of learning communities. Researchers also study how the data generated by gameplay can be used to design the next generation of learning assessments.

                    What this really shows is more and more people getting into video games every year and as the community grows so too does the number of friends you can gain from getting itno online gaming or joining a community like this.
                    There is no better outcome form any hobby than gaining a few loyal friends along the way and at the Games Hub we believe that is the truly greatest benefit you could gain from this particular hobby.
